# WindGust

This thesis focus on the development of statistical-based machine learning approaches for autoregressive models specifically tailored for real time and offline short-term wind gust forecasts. Furthermore, applicable procedures for time series analysis models, which are capable of handling generalized Gaussian distributed real-time data were developed. The developed models exhibited high binary classification rates with $AUC$ values approaching approximately $0.9$. Moreover, these models can be efficiently deployed on small-scale computing platforms for prototyping purposes.
