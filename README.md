# Autoregressive models on wind gust forecasts

This is the repository for the bachelor thesis by Maik van Do. All models are free to downloaded and able to perform time series forecasting for single time series with high temporal resolutions. All models are build on classical time series analysis instruments such as $AR(p)$. 



## Thesis abstract
This thesis focus on the development of statistical-based machine learning approaches for autoregressive models specifically tailored for real time and offline short-term wind gust forecasts. 
Furthermore, applicable procedures for time series analysis models, which are capable of handling generalized Gaussian distributed real-time data were developed. 
The developed models exhibited high binary classification rates with $AUC$ values approaching approximately $0.9$. 
Moreover, these models can be efficiently deployed on small-scale computing platforms for prototyping purposes.
